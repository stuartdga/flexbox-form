## Step by step demo of creating a form using Flexbox
This demo shows how to create a form using Flexbox with a responsive layout. Each file is a progression from beginning to end. The first step is to create a reusable pattern for a form field with a label and input. Then add the submit button, and so on. The form can contain multiple columns but narrows to a single column on a small screen.

Enjoy!
